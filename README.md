# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) E-Commerce Back End

## Introduction 
For this project we needed to create an back end for an e-commerce site. By using Express.js and Sequelize we were able to interact with a MYSQL database. 

## Installation
Users will need to download the packages by running the command 'npm i' in order to use this program. Users will also need to create a .env file in order to connect the program to Sequelize. They need to run mysql and download the .sql docs by typing 'mysql -u root -p' and entering their sequel password. Once that is entered they can run the command 'SOURCE db/schema.sql'. In order to attach the seeds users must then exit mysql by typing 'quit' and then entering the command 'npm run seed'. Once the download is complete they need to type 'npm start' in order to begin the app. Users will then be able to interact with the database by starting requests in Insomnia. By hitting 'cmd C' users can exit the program.
